Levelized Costs of Energy Calculator

I used this LCOE calculator while working on a uni project (im not studing energy), since I used it quite often, and it honestly saved me hours, I felt like i should thank them..

If you’re comparing things like solar vs wind, or diesel vs hydro, it helps you figure out the real cost per kilowatt-hour over a system’s lifetime (most of you propably know this already)
What it does:

You enter your capital cost, operating costs, system lifetime, discount rate, and annual energy output. It calculates the LCOE for you, thats it.

There’s also a chart tool to line up multiple systems side-by-side, which I found quite helpful for presentations.
So quickly why I would recommend it:

    Makes this whole LCOE math simple

    Great for feasibility studies or quick comparisons

    And most important, no dump sign-ups!

Big thanks to the people at Ovatrix for making this genuinely saved me.
