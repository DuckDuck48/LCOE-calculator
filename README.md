# Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) Calculator

I came across this LCOE calculator while working on a university project (I'm not studying energy, by the way). It ended up saving me a lot of time, so I wanted to share it.

If you're comparing things like solar vs wind, or diesel vs hydro, this tool helps you figure out the real cost per kilowatt-hour over a system’s lifetime.(but you probably already know this)

### What It Does

You enter your:
- Capital cost
- Operating and fuel costs
- System lifetime
- Discount rate
- Annual energy output

And it calculates the Levelized Cost of Energy for you, that's it. There’s also a chart feature to compare multiple systems side-by-side, which was quite useful for keeping track of everything.

### Why I Recommend It

- Makes LCOE calculations easy
- Great for feasibility studies and quick comparisons
- No annoying sign-ups or logins
- Works in € or $

Big thanks to the folks at Ovatrix, genuinely saved me.
